                        Rapid urbanization poses social and environmental challenges. Addressing these issues
effectively requires access to accurate and up-to-date 3D building models, obtained promptly and
cost-effectively. Urban modeling is an interdisciplinary topic among computer vision, graphics,
and photogrammetry. The demand for automated interpretation of scene geometry and semantics
has surged due to various applications, including autonomous navigation, augmented reality,
smart cities, and digital twins. As a result, substantial research effort has been dedicated to urban
scene modeling within the computer vision and graphics communities, with a particular focus on
photogrammetry, which has coped with urban modeling challenges for decades.
This workshop is intended to bring researchers from these communities together. Through invited
talks, spotlight presentations, a workshop challenge, and a poster session, it will increase
interdisciplinary interaction and collaboration among photogrammetry, computer vision and
graphics. We also solicit original contributions in the areas related to urban scene modeling. The
list of suggested topics includes but is not limited to:

                                                <p>In this tutorial, we first introduce the fundamentals of cycle-consistency and review the broad range of studies that make use of it. Next, we cover different techniques for solving multiview synchronization problems in computer vision, or in other words for achieving cycle consistency. Several techniques including graph theory, combinatorial optimization, Riemannian geometry, spectral decomposition, (non-)convex optimization, and MAP inference will be addressed. Besides optimization techniques, we will also discuss the uncertainty and ambiguities inherent either in the data or in the model and show how the existing tools can be augmented to yield this valuable piece of information. We will finally showcase the applications of synchronizing linear/non-linear maps. Tools and methods presented in this tutorial are beneficial to a large audience as the synchronization is a common technique across several sub-fields of computer vision.</p>

												<h4><b>Abstract</b></h4>
												<p>A fundamental problem in synchronization is to develop efficient computational formulations for the combinatorial constraints, including the cycle-consistency constraint for undirected graphs and the path-invariance constraint for directed graphs. This talk discusses advances on this topic during the past two decades, from greedy combinatorial approaches, constrained matrix recovery formulations, to very recent methods that utilize cycle-consistency bases and path-invariance bases joint learning of neural networks. We focus on the interplay between continuous optimization and graph theoretical approaches, exact and robust recovery conditions, and connections between synchronization and symmetries. We conclude the talk with a list of future directions.</p>

													Federica Arrigoni received her MS degree in Mathematics from the University of Milan (Italy) in 2013, and the PhD degree in Industrial and Information Engineering from the University of Udine (Italy) in 2018. Her PhD thesis titled “Synchronization Problems in Computer Vision” was awarded from the Italian Association for Computer Vision, Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (CVPL) in 2018 and from the University of Udine in 2019. From 2018 to 2020 she was a postdoctoral researcher with the Czech Institute of Informatics, Robotics, and Cybernetics (CIIRC) of the Czech Technical University in Prague. She is currently an assistant professor with the Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science of the University of Trento (Italy). Her research focuses on geometric problems in computer vision, including structure from motion, 3D registration, multi-image matching and motion segmentation.

												<h4><b>Abstract</b></h4>
												<p>
												The “synchronization” problem is traditionally defined as the task of recovering unknown group elements (represented as nodes in a graph) starting from a set of pairwise ratios/differences (represented as edges in a graph). Particularly interesting is the case where the group admits a matrix representation (e.g., rotations/rigid-motions/permutations), where the unknown elements can be recovered via spectral decomposition. The spectral solution is very general and can be also applied to situations where the group structure is missing, such as the case of binary matrices, which appear in the context of motion segmentation.
A tightly related problem is “bearing-based localization”, where the task is to compute the position of nodes in a graph starting from a set of pairwise directions. Recovering camera positions in a structure-from-motion system is an instance of bearing-based localization in 3D. This problem is well posed when the underlying graph is “parallel rigid”. An interesting formulation of localizability can be found by imposing “cycle-consistency”, namely the property that the sum of pairwise directions (weighted with unknown scales) along any cycle in the graph is zero.

													Leonidas Guibas is the Paul Pigott Professor of Computer Science (and by courtesy, Electrical Engineering) at Stanford University, where he heads the Geometric Computation group.  Dr. Guibas obtained his Ph.D. from Stanford University  under the supervision of Donald Knuth. His main subsequent employers were Xerox PARC, DEC/SRC, MIT, and Stanford. He is a member and past acting director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and a member of the Computer Graphics Laboratory, the Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering (iCME) and the Bio-X program. Dr. Guibas has been elected to the US National Academy of Engineering and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and is an ACM Fellow, an IEEE Fellow and winner of the ACM Allen Newell award and the ICCV Helmholtz prize. He is also a recent recipient of a five-year DoD Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship.

												<h4><b>Abstract</b></h4>
												<p>This presentation will introduce the machinery of functional maps between images or between 3D shapes. Traditional maps are pixel-to-pixel or point-to-point maps -- while functional maps are generalizations, mapping between function spaces defined over images or over 3D shapes and containing the former as special cases. As such, they are dual objects but come with two key advantages: (1) they are always linear mappings, allowing us to use many powerful tools from linear algebra and optimization, and (2), they enable us to express complex mappings compactly through the use of hierarchical function bases on the underlying objects. Fundamentally, functional maps act as information transporters -- since many important semantic properties of images or shapes, such as features or parts, can be encoded as functions.

When we have many related images or 3D shapes connected via functional maps into a network, we can explore the consistency of information transport by following different paths in the network. Consistent functional maps are said to be synchronized. We describe algebraic conditions for synchronization and algorithms that can take noisy initial maps and improve their consistency -- and in the process also improve their quality in transferring semantic knowledge. We show a detailed example for the case of the image or 3D shape co-segmentation problem. We also describe applications to understanding shape differences and the analysis of shape collections.</p>
